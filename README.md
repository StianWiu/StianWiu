# Hello World

Hi! My name is **Stian**, I'm a student & web developer from South-Eastern Norway.

I have been actively coding for a few years now, I code as a hobby but I'm working to become a full time developer in the near future.
I am a very introverted person as all developers are, I love helping others without anything in return like developing websites or Discord bots etc.

I am currently in the process of learning VueJS, but I already know NodeJS, Typescript, Lua, Python and a bit of ReactJs,

Here are some of my projects you can check out

* [Pykho.dev](https://pykho.dev) Made with ReactJs
* [StianWiu.me](https://stianwiu.me) Made with plain html,css,js
