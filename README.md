Hi, I'm Stian more widely known as Pignuuu I'm a student from Norway that does coding as a hobby but hopefully it will become much more in the near future. I know how to code JavaScript, TypeScript, Lua, Python, Css & Html. Shut up I know it's not a programming language but a markup language just let me sound cool knowing 6 programming "languages". I have a website if you are interested (stianwiu.me)[https://stianwiu.me]. My favourite number is 3 and my favourite color is purple. :-)
